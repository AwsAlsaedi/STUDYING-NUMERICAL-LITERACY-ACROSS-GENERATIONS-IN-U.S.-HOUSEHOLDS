Short description: We analyze how numerical literacy persists within individuals, transmits from parents to children, and relates to wealth outcomes across generations. Data come from PSID and CDS. Code is here. Raw data are not distributed.

## Status
Active research. Private repo. Results are preliminary.

## Data access
- PSID and CDS data are under user agreements. We do not redistribute raw files.
- Place raw files locally under `data/raw/` (gitignored).
