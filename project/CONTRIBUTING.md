# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research project.

## Rules
- **Do not commit raw PSID or CDS data** — these are restricted and must remain local.
- **Do not commit secrets** such as API keys or personal credentials.
- Keep heavy logic and reusable code in the `src/` directory.
- Keep notebooks light — mainly for analysis and visualization.
- Name notebooks with numeric prefixes for execution order (e.g., `01_data_prep.ipynb`).
- Document changes clearly in commit messages.

## Workflow
1. Create a new branch for your changes.
2. Make changes locally or in the web interface.
3. Open a Pull Request (PR) into the `main` branch.
4. A review will be required before merging.

## Style
- Use clear variable names and comments.
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code.
- Ensure all scripts run without errors before committing.
